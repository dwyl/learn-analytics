**_Understand_ `Analytics`**
so you can **build** a **better** product/service
through **data-driven decision-making**.

</div>

# Why? üí≠

While _most_ companies/organizations
have `Analytics` for their
website and/or app,
many do not _use_ the `data`
to inform their **decisions**.
Our **_extensive_ experience** with **100+ clients**
over **10 years** running a web/app development agency,
working in several startups and advising _many_ more,
is that **people are not _naturally_ data-driven**.
Even the **larger enterprises** with a data _team_
**do not pay enough attention** to insights.

The most successful companies/organizations
_listen_ to the data
and take _action_.

> **Note**: we don't advocate
> dogmatically following data
> and ignoring what people say/think.
> We favour a blended approach
> that is guided by data
> and humans with empathy
> for the people using the product/service.

# Who? üë•

This guide is for **_busy_ people**
who don't have _time_
to read a whole
[_**book**_](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=analytics)
on `Analytics`;
of which there are many good ones
we have read and can recommend. üìö

## [Cui Bono?](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cui_bono) (Who _Benefits_?)

**_All_ members** of the organization benefit
from being aware of the `Analytics`
because it gives **_realtime_ insight**
into the **product _usage_**.

A short list to guide your thinking:

1. **Product Owners/Managers** who need to understand
   how people are using their product/service.
2. **Founders/Entrepreneurs** seeking clarity on usage and friction points.
3. **Executives** needing stats to inform their decisions.
4. **Developers/Engineers** needing to _know_ which features are used or _not_.
5. **Customer Service** needing to know where people
   are getting stuck when using the product/service.

# What? üìä

A **_complete_ beginner's guide**
to **_Open Source_ `Analytics`**
that _anyone_ can follow
regardless of statistical knowledge
or industry experience.

## _So_ What? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Knowing _exactly_ how people are _using_
your digital product/service or website
is the difference between success and _failure_.
We cannot say definitively why
[65% of businesses fail](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1010/top-6-reasons-new-businesses-fail.aspx) ...
but we _know_ one thing for _sure_:
**_highly_ successful companies** like `Google`, `Amazon`
are **_hyper_ focussed** on their **`Analytics`**.
_All_ the executives, product owners and builders know _exactly_
which
[OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results)
they are focussing on and exclude everything else.

Counterpoint: we cannot rule-out
[confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)
or
[survivorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)
bias, meaning we may ignore companies that failed
while being somewhat data-driven.
e.g: the businesses that failed also listened to `data`,
just the
[_wrong_ `data`](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9923896-management-is-doing-things-right-leadership-is-doing-the-right).

# When? ‚è≥

Get started _today_
in less than **5 minutes**
by **_speed reading_ part 2** of this guide. <br />
Then decide how far you want to take your `Analytics` journey.

# How? üë©‚Äçüíª

This repo is divided into 3 parts:

1. **_Deploy_**: deploy `Plausible Analytics` "**_Community_ Edition**"
   on your chosen infrastructure; in our case `DigitalOcean`.
   > **Note**: the instructions use `Docker`
   so any competent
   [`DevOps`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops)
   person can deploy it in **`~20mins`**
   on _any_ Cloud provider
   (e.g: `AWS`, `Azure`, `Google Cloud`, etc.)
   by following the detailed step-by-step instructions.
2. **_Navigate_**: a guided tour of the `Analytics` _interface_
   to understand everything that we can learn from it.
3. **Take _Action_**: Sample _actions_ that can be taken
   based on the _insights_ we learn from our `Analytics`.

Any `Plausible`-related information can be found in the
[`plausible`](./plausible/)
folder,
where you can get quickly get started on setting up a `Plausible CE` instance
and a `Next.js` website,
both on `localhost`.
You'll also learn how to deploy `Plausible` to `DigitalOcean`!
